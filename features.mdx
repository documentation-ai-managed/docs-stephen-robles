## Document Organization and Folders

Organize your documentation hierarchically using folders and subfolders. Create unlimited nested structures to match your project needs, such as separating API docs, user guides, and changelogs.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Folder" icon="folder-plus">
    Navigate to the root directory and select "New Folder". Name it descriptively, like `api-reference`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Move Documents" icon="move">
    Drag and drop files into folders or use the right-click context menu for bulk operations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tag for Search" icon="tag">
    Add tags like `featured` or `draft` for quick filtering across folders.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use consistent naming conventions, such as `v1.0-user-guide`, to keep your structure intuitive.

## Version Control and Editing Tools

Built-in version control lets you track every change, compare diffs, and restore previous versions. The rich text editor supports Markdown, MDX components, and real-time previews.

```javascript
// Example: Save a document version via API
const docId = 'doc-123';
await fetch(`https://api.example.com/docs/${docId}/versions`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({ content: updatedMarkdown })
});
```

<Expandable title="Advanced Diff Viewer" default-open="false">
  View side-by-side changes with syntax highlighting. Filter by author or date range for focused reviews.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Team Invite" icon="mail">
    Send invites via email. Set expiration dates for temporary access.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Public Sharing" icon="globe">
    Generate shareable links with optional password protection.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Export and Publishing Workflows

Export your docs to multiple formats for publishing. Integrate with static site generators or host directly on custom domains.

<CodeGroup tabs="Markdown,PDF,HTML">
  ```bash
  # Export to Markdown bundle
  docs export project-folder --format md --output ./exports
  ```
  ```bash
  # Generate PDF
  docs export project-folder --format pdf --theme dark
  ```
  ```bash
  # Build HTML site
  docs publish project-folder --domain custom-docs.com
  ```
</CodeGroup>

| Format | Use Case | Customization |
|--------|----------|---------------|
